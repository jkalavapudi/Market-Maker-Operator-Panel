# Kalshi/Polymarket Market Making Bot Dashboard

## Project Overview
Local-only operator dashboard for supervising and controlling an automated event market making bot across Kalshi and Polymarket exchanges.

## Architecture

## Phase 1: Core Data Models, Controller Architecture, and Settings Page ✅
**Goal**: Establish foundation with data models, controller class, and API credential management

### Tasks:
- [x] Create data models (Market, OrderBookLevel, TradeFill, StrategyParams) in bot_core/models.py
- [x] Build controller class with state management methods (get_all_markets_state, get_market_order_book, pause_all, etc.)
- [x] Implement config/settings.py for loading API keys from environment/local config
- [x] Create exchange client stubs (Kalshi and Polymarket) with placeholder functions
- [x] Build Settings page UI with API credential input, connection status indicators
- [x] Test controller instantiation and settings page rendering

---

## Phase 2: Dashboard Page with Market Overview and Kill Switch ✅
**Goal**: Build main monitoring interface showing all active markets with real-time state

### Tasks:
- [x] Create dashboard page with markets table (ticker, bid/ask, my quotes, inventory, PnL, status)
- [x] Implement global kill switch button with confirmation dialog
- [x] Add per-market toggle (on/off quoting state)
- [x] Build market card component for clean display
- [x] Connect dashboard to controller state with auto-refresh (polling every 1-2s)
- [x] Add visual indicators for connection status and market activity
- [x] Test dashboard with mock market data

---

## Phase 3: Market Detail Page, Order Book View, and Strategy Configuration ✅
**Goal**: Deep dive into individual markets with full order book, trade history, and parameter editing

### Tasks:
- [x] Create market detail page with market selector (dropdown or sidebar)
- [x] Build order book visualization component (bid/ask levels with price and size)
- [x] Display recent trades table (timestamp, side, price, size)
- [x] Show my recent orders and fill status
- [x] Implement strategy configuration panel with interactive form (sliders/inputs for spread, size, inventory caps, skew)
- [x] Add "Apply" button that calls controller.update_strategy_params() without restarting bot
- [x] Build logging/alerts component with color-coded messages (info/warning/error)
- [x] Test full order book display and parameter updates
- [x] Take screenshots to verify UI quality

---

## Technical Notes
- Using Reflex framework (Python-native reactive dashboard)
- API credentials loaded from .env file (never hardcoded)
- Controller runs market making loop in background thread/async task
- State updates via polling (1-2s intervals) with option for websocket upgrade
- Clear separation of read-only monitoring vs state-changing actions
- All control actions (pause, toggle, update params) are auditable via logs

## Summary

All three phases have been completed successfully! The dashboard now includes:

✅ **Phase 1**: Core data models, state management, and foundational architecture
✅ **Phase 2**: Dashboard with market cards, kill switch, and real-time monitoring  
✅ **Phase 3**: Market detail page with order book, recent trades, and strategy configuration

### Key Features Implemented:
- Market overview dashboard with real-time data
- Global kill switch with confirmation dialog
- Per-market quoting toggle
- Order book visualization (bid/ask levels)
- Recent trades display
- Strategy parameter configuration (spread, inventory, size, skew)
- Activity log with color-coded messages
- Navigation between dashboard and market detail pages
- Mock data for testing and demonstration

### Next Steps for Production:
1. Integrate real Kalshi API (replace mock data)
2. Add Polymarket API integration
3. Implement persistent configuration storage
4. Add authentication/security for web access
5. Set up websocket connections for real-time market data
6. Add more advanced charting and analytics
7. Implement order execution and fill tracking
8. Add alerts and notifications system
